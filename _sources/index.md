# Machine Learning for Trading

This is a collection of notes for Georgia Tech's CS7646, Machine Learning for Trading.

Below is a brief overview of the material covered from the course's [website](http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/ml4t/):

```{admonition} Course Overview
This course introduces students to the real world challenges of implementing machine learning based trading strategies including the algorithmic steps from information gathering to market orders. The focus is on how to apply probabilistic machine learning approaches to trading decisions. We consider statistical approaches like linear regression, Q-Learning, KNN and regression trees and how to apply them to actual stock trading situations.
```

This book is structured in 3 main chapters as the course is run:
- [Manipulating Financial Data  in Python](http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/ml4t/manipulating-financial-data-in-python/)
- [Computational Investing](http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/ml4t/computational-investing/)
- [Machine Learning Algorithms for Trading](http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/ml4t/machine-learning-algorithms-for-trading/)


The main goal of this book is to learn in public. There will be plenty of typos and errors, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.

Happy learning!
